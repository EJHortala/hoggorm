# hoggorm
Hoggorm is a Python package for explorative multivariate statistics in Python. It contains PCA (principal component analysis), PCR (principal component regression), PLSR (partial least squares regression) and the matrix corrlation coefficients RV and RV2.

Hoggorm focuses mainly on interpretation of the variance in the data, unlike scikit-learn which focuses on classification and predicition.
