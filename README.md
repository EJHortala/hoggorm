# hoggorm
Hoggorm is a Python package for explorative multivariate statistics in Python. It contains PCA (principal component analysis), PCR (principal component regression), PLSR (partial least squares regression) and the matrix corrlation coefficients RV and RV2.

Unlike scikit-learn, an excellent python machine learning package focusing on classification and predicition, hoggorm aims at understanding and interpretation of the variance in the data.
